# ECE6460_Homework4
Continuation of Homework 3. 

## Description
Here you are required to program the entire simulated annealing algorithm for slicing floorplan. The algorithm is described in detail in the textbook (page 121), and is also discussed in class. To develop this algorithm, you will use the cost() routine developed in HW3.
